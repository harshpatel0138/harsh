        <p>The
            table tag in HTML is used to create a table that organizes data into rows and columns. It acts as a
            container
            for all the other table-related tags like tr, td,
            th, thead,
            tbody, and
            tfoot. Tables are especially useful for displaying structured data such as statistics, schedules,
            or any kind of tabular information.</p>
        <p>The
            table tag doesn't display borders or spacing by default, but you can style it using CSS to
            control layout, alignment, colors, and borders. A table must include at least one <tr>
                (table row), and inside each row, one or more td (table data) or
                th(table header) cells</p>
        <p> tr and th tag :The tr tag stands for "table row". It is used to define a single row in an HTML table. Inside
            a tr, you place either tr(header) or td (data) cells. You need at least one tr in every table, and each
            table can have multiple tr elements to display multiple rows of content.</p>
